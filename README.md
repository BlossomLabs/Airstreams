# Airstream: Streaming Airdrops with Superfluid

Airstreams is a continuous airdrop solution that leverages Superfluid's streaming technology to reward users over time while mitigating sudden price drops. By streaming tokens instead of distributing them all at once, Airstreams encourages active user engagement and promotes long-term value generation for your product.

## Key Benefit: Mitigate Sudden Price Drops

Traditional airdrops often lead to users claiming tokens in bulk, resulting in mass sales and sudden price drops on exchanges. Airstreams addresses this issue by streaming tokens over time, reducing the risk of large-scale sell-offs and providing a more stable token distribution model.

## Supported Tokens and Networks

Airstreams currently supports all ERC20 tokens on the **base** network.
